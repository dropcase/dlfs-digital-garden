## My Own History

I learned how to knit back in August 2006. It started with US 9 straight needles and pale green yarn. As soon as I learned how to cast on, I was into it and thinking about what I could make.

Fast forward a bit and life finds a way to shift things around. I did knit from time to time, but nothing consistent. I learned more stitches and cast-ons and cast-offs, bought yarn (the stash!) and needles, saved patterns that looked interesting... and that's about where it stopped.

Now in 2025, I'm finally getting back into it and actually trying to finish a project. [[output/write/2025/Knitting and Making\|Knitting and Making]] has some more around the current state of things.

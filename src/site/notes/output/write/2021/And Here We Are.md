## The Premise

I need to set a goal for this site. Minimum of two posts every month. Or what? There's no consequence, there's not a committee or boss to report to.

## The Problem

I need to make time, amongst the many things I'm interested in, during free time that I have with a family and a full-time job.

### The Other Problem

Not sure that it's a problem as much as something else to keep an eye out for. Once I make time, I need to make time __for__ this. I've been feeling like it recently, and I think writing is one of those things that finally "clicked" for me.

## The Other Stuff

Well, I wrote this four years ago and I'm sure I lost momentum when I ran into more problems figuring out the platform (I think it was Hexo) than creating content. That's not to say it was Hexo's fault, I couldn't translate what I wanted _into_ how Hexo worked.

Still would've been nice to just write and publish when it's ready. I couldn't get it repeatable enough (aka low friction) and it kind of was something I checked on rather than added to. It's why I tagged this with `#hobby-chasing` and wasn't using one thing consistently for writing until [[input/learn/Roam\|Roam]] in 2020.

That let me connect things that made sense to me and I could easily figure out something that I wrote about or saved. I wanted my site to work like it did, linking things together easily (low friction) and worked as a [[reference/2025/Static Site Generator\|Static Site Generator]].

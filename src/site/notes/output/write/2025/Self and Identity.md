## Yourself, or Your Self?

One thing that I've enjoyed for a long time is thinking about consciousness and identity. Luckily I have a close friend who is also into that, and bonus - he's built a list of books he's either read or wants to that are around a lot of these ideas.

For example, I've been reading [[input/read/2025/The untethered soul (2007)\|The untethered soul (2007)]] and it's slow progress. Not because it's challenging to read, but because I read a few pages and it kicks off a lot of thoughts and processing them.

You are not your name, or any of the other labels you've learned. You're not your body, you're the one observing all of the thoughts and feelings and sensory input. Who is that?

Maybe I'll post a list of some of the books once I've read more of them myself. It'll either end up on [[input/read/Books\|Books]] or less likely a separate post around them.

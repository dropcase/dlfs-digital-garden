## It's Here, Really!

I've been waiting for [[input/learn/Obsidian\|Obsidian]] to release the update so we can start using [Bases](https://help.obsidian.md/bases). From the demos and info I've seen, it could make a huge difference for a lot of people's vaults.

Now I need to find out if they'll work with this [[input/follow/Obsidian Digital Garden\|Obsidian Digital Garden]] setup (spoiler, as of 2025-08-23 they don't). Even though the Dataview plugin is great, having this all built in is just that much better.

If you need a good starting point, check out the [sample vault](https://stephango.com/vault) from [[input/follow/kepano\|kepano]] (aka the current CEO of [[input/learn/Obsidian\|Obsidian]]). It includes a great set of Templates and Bases and examples to help get you started. I pulled a lot of it into my own vault when I migrated away from [[input/learn/Roam\|Roam]] in 2024.

Now that I've tested them out a bit, I can see that there's a lot that went into Bases. So far it's easy to use, easy to update (I can update _in the list_ itself?!), easy to create and reference views, and I'm already thinking of more ways to use it.

The only downside? Now I have to update a lot of notes to use Bases instead of whatever is already there. It's fine, it'll just take a while to get through all 9900+ notes.

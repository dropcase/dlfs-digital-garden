I did it, finally got back up and running on the domain I've had for _checks watch_ 22 years as of this past May. This post was almost called `Even Small Steps Make Progress` but it felt like it was missing something in the point.

There's been a few times where I've had it _click_ that what I was working on wasn't even just good enough, it was usually more than what was needed (aka "oh wait one more thing").

In this case, the last posted update to this site was March 2018. Since then there's been a lot of changes (even outside of a global pandemic and turbulent US events), and even with more than a few false starts, I couldn't find something that worked well for me.

Now that I've found [[input/follow/Obsidian Digital Garden\|Obsidian Digital Garden]] it's a combo of two things I enjoy: [[input/learn/Obsidian\|Obsidian]] and [[input/learn/Eleventy\|Eleventy]], which work great together. I can write using a platform I like and am comfortable with, and publish for free with a combo of Eleventy and [[input/dev/Vercel\|Vercel]] through an easy to use plugin. It's as low-friction as I need.

Setting the bar low and looking to get at least one post a month. Anything more than that and it ends up delving into something I'd rather not do at all (kind of like a slow burn).

Now it's out there, getting updated and filling out more content along the way. What's next?

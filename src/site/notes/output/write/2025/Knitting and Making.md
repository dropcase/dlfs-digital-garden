## Made it Myself

I learned how to knit back in 2006, and really just messed around with things for a long time and made only a couple of things. A short-row hat, a _lot_ of swatches (often frogged shortly after), and a few other small things.

Now that I'm in a different living situation and my kids are older, I've started getting back into [[output/make/knitting\|knitting]] and actually making something. Part of it was related to talking to a close friend about knitting and his excitement - he'd love a cardigan!

That's a bit larger than I want to take on yet, so I did some searching and ended up buying more yarn the next day (oops) after finding some good pattern ideas. It was BOGO 50% off! I also got a couple of skeins of [Wool-Ease® Thick & Quick® Yarn – Lion Brand Yarn](https://www.lionbrand.com/products/wool-ease-thick-and-quick-yarn) to make hats with.

Found a good pattern from Lion Brand, then realized that US11 is one size I don't have in straight, circular, or DPNs. Now I'm trying out [32" Circular Knitting Needles, US 11 (8mm) — Prym Consumer USA Inc.](https://www.prymconsumerusa.com/products/57089) and so far they've been great. I'm not a particularly fast knitter, the texture is just enough to keep stitches from slipping and the "nubs" make it easy to pick up, even with purl stitches (which are usually off-tension for me).

Now I'm working through the first hat and making slow progress. Maybe I'll post a picture of the finished product once I bind off. I like working with my hands, and it's great to have tangible progress sometimes.

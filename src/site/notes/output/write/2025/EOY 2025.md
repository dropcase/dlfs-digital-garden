## How was your year?
This year is ending differently than it began in a lot of ways. A lot of new experiences, some familiar ones, and a lot of updates across the board. Glad for vacation time to decompress and get ready for what's next.

I'm [reading]([[input/read/Books\|Books]]) more, [[output/write/2025/Knitting and Making\|Knitting and Making]] more, playing D&D more (and for the first time in many many years), reconnected with old friends, and even brought this site back from stagnancy. Speaking of knitting, I finished my first piece and it didn't take an embarrassingly long time to complete!

I know there are people that do a whole retrospective on their year. Not quite at that point yet but I did do a lot of writing along the way this year. Most of it is in my [[reference/2025/Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] so I can refer back to it, maybe it's time to do more weekly and monthly notes.

There are people and things I'm thankful for, plenty I wish could be different, and overall still trying to be a positive person making progress in this insane place called Earth.

Best wishes to anyone reading this, hoping 2026 will get us into the right direction again.

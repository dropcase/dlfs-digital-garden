## Or Put More Simply, _Fall_

I talked about it a bit in [[output/write/2021/Feeling Autumnal\|Feeling Autumnal]], I'm not a fan of shorter days, although the cooler nights are great for sleeping.

The light not only fades earlier, but I can also see how it comes into my office space differently. It's a nice reminder of the flow of the year and even if I'm feeling stuck, the light guides me out of it.

Autumn also means apple season (I'm in the Northeastern US). I like apples on their own, then there's cider and fritters and donuts and pies and more.

The changes to the colors too, the leaves changing into bright orange, yellow, and reds. It's interesting to see how the change is like a wave starting further north. When there's a bright sunny day it almost looks like some of the trees are made of fire and it's beautiful.

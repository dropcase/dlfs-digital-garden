## Sorry, A What?

Someone in a conversation recently was talking about slow progress and said, "...like I don't know, a turtle year. Not sure if that's even a thing..."

It is now, a few of us really liked it.

## Shuffling Ahead

This kind of ties into some of the other recent notes, like [[output/write/2025/Perfect is the Enemy of Good Enough\|Perfect is the Enemy of Good Enough]] (and the alternate title for it). I used to think that I had to make a "big move" to get any progress, whether in relationships or at work or in school. There had to be a leap or something that would "obviously" cause an impact, or it wouldn't count.

As I've gotten older, written a lot in various [[reference/2025/Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] options, and many years of therapy, I finally settled back from that and dropped a lot of the urgency where there doesn't need to be any. Yes it still pops into my head from time to time, I recognize that and remember that I see small changes as lasting changes.

Finding patience helps, and that ties into the title. Sometimes it feels like it takes a turtle year to see any changes, and sometimes that's true. I'd rather have it that way instead of how I was, trying to rocket out of wherever I was into something else.

## Like a Badge, or a Blanket

I was talking to a friend recently (we're the same age) and both of us are hitting the point of caring less and less what others think of us. I'm in my late 40s now, with plenty of wrinkles and white hair and have pulled muscles or whatever from things that my teenage self wouldn't've even noticed.

As I've gotten older and settled into myself more, I've realized that I don't care what others do as long as it's not harmful (especially to others). Dye your hair? Botox? Surgery? It's a personal decision and it doesn't matter if I do or don't get why.

My take is that I'm just getting older and letting it happen, which I summed up as Wearing My Life. I'm not trying to hide what's happening to me, and trying not to get sucked into chasing my own youth.

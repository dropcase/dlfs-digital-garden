## One? I Made Two Already

First, the pattern: [Pike Street Hat (Knit) – Lion Brand Yarn](https://www.lionbrand.com/collections/all-knit-crochet-patterns/products/pike-street-hat-l70288)

### My take on it

I like it, one skein and it knits up decently quickly - even for a slower knitter like me. The only things you need to know are knit, purl, k2tog (knit 2 together), and working with either circulars (yay magic loop) and DPNs or just DPNs. The pattern calls for US 11 (8mm).

## Just Follow the Pattern

For the first time through, mistakes were made. The ribbing was offset at the bottom, and I think I missed a couple of the decreases. It's ok though, it was a test and for me so I don't mind the wonky look. Oh, and the picture shows it inside out:

The second hat came out much better! I was also more careful since it's a gift for a friend. The ribbing came out great, the stitches were even, the decreases lined up well, and the woven ends were cleaner. Here's that one:

It's been a good time getting back into [[output/make/knitting\|knitting]], especially since I've completed two projects. It's something I like and glad I'm continuing from [[output/write/2025/Knitting and Making\|Knitting and Making]].

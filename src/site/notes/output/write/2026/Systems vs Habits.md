## Yes, There's Gray Area

As someone with ADHD, habits are a bittersweet idea. Do something almost without thinking about it? Sounds great! Too bad my brain tends toward making habits a bit more ethereal.

I'm definitely not the first person to think about this:
- [Why systems are better than habits. - Rock Your Writing](https://www.rockyourwriting.com/2024/06/systems/)
- [Forget About Setting Goals. Focus on This Instead.](https://jamesclear.com/goals-systems)
- [Systems vs Habits: A New Approach for Achievement \| by Marquis Harris \| Medium](https://medium.com/@MarquisJH/systems-vs-habits-a-new-approach-for-achievement-877ca7c98c6d)

Neurodivergence for me means that I need systems to make sure I'm doing things they way I want in a consistent way. Of course, I also don't like rigidity and using the things that help (sometimes helping the most). Habits don't really form, and if I don't have a system to follow then either steps get missed or might not get done.

### Small example: making coffee

I would get it all ready the night before so we could wake up to a fresh pot. I would clean things out, add a filter and coffee, fill up the water, and no problem.

Until there was a problem. I forgot to fill the water reservoir several times, and one night I even forgot to dump the old coffee (yuck).

System time. I figured out the best order for me to "process" the steps:
1. Clean and fill the water reservoir
2. Clean the filter basket
3. Measure coffee in a filter (by weight) and replace basket
4. Clean out the carafe and replace

Fast forward six months and no issues. No missed steps, no old coffee.

## But Wait, There's More

For other systems I've put together, I've included "markers" to remind myself that the steps were completed. I used to lock up the house we were in at night: check the doors, lock up, turn off the lights.

Since one of the doors was from a mudroom, I couldn't see without opening a door. Instead of re-checking, I made sure to note that the light switch was turned off. That meant I could just peek at the switch and know I'd done everything else.

I know these aren't very exciting systems, which is also a reason to _have_ a system for less exciting things. I'm also applying them to areas like my [[reference/2025/Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] - for example, I have a Style Guide for my personal setup so I not only know _what_ I'm trying to do, but also _why_ the systems are how they are.

Chase that dopamine and follow the system. It doesn't need to make sense to anyone else if it works for you.

## It's Not the Beginning

I can't count how many times I've "started over" this site since it began in May of 2003. I'm sure that if I looked hard enough I could pull up the archived version of everything from the Greymatter, Drupal, and Dokuwiki versions, along with the little one-off pages. I don't plan on it though; at least not any time in the near future. Maybe instead of the middle this is more of a rebirth.

Now? I'm right in the middle. The middle of the year, middle of projects at work and home, hell I'm even middle aged(ish). Middle-age isn't too bad so far - no plans for a fast car or big changes, I have enough to work on as it is. Still learning and trying apply what I'm learning to life. Sometimes that's easy; a lot of the time it isn't.

I'm even in the middle of designing this site, again. Definitely not giving up, just slowly building back up to being visible again.

Luckily I've found an [[reference/2025/Static Site Generator\|SSG]] that I like, called [Hexo](https://hexo.io/). No crazy setup, javascript based, and plays nice with GitLab and [[input/dev/GitHub\|GitHub]] - along with plenty of other options. Posts are written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) so they're readable by people **and** machines, no fancy editor needed.

I might backfill some of the posts from other places, or just link to them at some point. It's really just filling out more of the middle stuff until I can find the edges.

## Time to Re-Re-Re-Restart the Process

Scattered throughout this site, you'll find more than one starting point. Some from old copies of content, some while I was trying to get changed over to another platform, and some just because I wrote it and wanted to keep it. This is another one of those starting points.

One day I'll pull a bunch of the ideas out of my [[reference/2025/Obsidian\|Obsidian]] vault and make them into notes here. Until that happens, it'll just be slowly piecing together the framework and foundation of the site to build from. I know that the [[About\|About]] page has some of it, and I'll try to connect more ideas together along the way.

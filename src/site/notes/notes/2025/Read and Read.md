## Where it Started and Where it Went

As a kid, I was a voracious reader up into high school. Yes, it was before the internet and streaming, I still loved books and bookstores and going to the library.

Fast forward a decade or three to today and I'm rebuilding my reading habits. Where I currently live makes it easy, there's a library about a three minute walk from me and open until 8pm a couple of times a week.

## Tracking, Tracking, Tracked

I'm also someone who likes to keep track of certain things, like [[reference/2025/Trakt\|Trakt]] for movies and series, as well as books and reading. For a while I was trying out [[reference/2025/Goodreads\|Goodreads]] but something didn't click for me.

Most recently I've been using [[reference/2025/StoryGraph\|StoryGraph]] which is easy and I like the interface to both capture books as well as progress. Unfortunately, they don't currently have an API which makes pulling data from it less straightforward (other than exporting a csv).

Now I'm headed down the rabbit hole of reading trackers, including:

- Bookwyrm - [Welcome - BookWyrm](https://bookwyrm.social/)
- [[reference/2025/Goodreads\|Goodreads]] - [Goodreads | Meet your next favorite book](https://www.goodreads.com/)
- Hardcover.app - [Hardcover - Social discovery for serious book lovers](https://hardcover.app/)
- LibraryThing - [LibraryThing \| Catalog your books online \| LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/)
- Open Library - [Welcome to Open Library \| Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/)
- [[reference/2025/StoryGraph\|StoryGraph]] - [The StoryGraph | Because life's too short for a book you're not in the mood for.](https://thestorygraph.com/)

## Looking Ahead

I'll eventually expand on some (or all) of these and expand the list as time goes on. For now, I'm going to stick with StoryGraph until I have a better idea of what I want to be able to do. Some of the features that I want from the platform I use:

- Track books, both reading status and ownership (and/or source)
- Track reading progress, at least to the day level
- Free tier option
- API access, I'd like to pull info into my [[reference/2025/Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]], preferably through a plugin in [[reference/2025/Obsidian\|Obsidian]]

## Yes, I missed December. No, I won't retro-post something.

It's 2022, a year we didn't know would start like this. We're going on two full years of the official global pandemic. Covid has mutated a few times with Omicron as the latest (not to be confused with Unicron, the planet-sized villain from [The Transformers: The Movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092106/)).

In talking to some people at work, I realized that I enjoy writing when I have something to say (which is often). The issue is that I don't make enough time to fully flesh out the ideas in my head, or I start to and shift focus to, well - anything else.

I've been in my own office at home for almost two months. Having a space to myself is just as helpful as what I can do, whether it's my day job, messing around with code or webdev, tending to terrariums, or anything else that I chase dopamine for.

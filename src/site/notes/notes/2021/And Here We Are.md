# The Premise

I need to set a goal for this site. Minimum of two posts every month. Or what? There's no consequence, there's not a committee or boss to report to.

I need to make time, amongst the many things I'm interested in, during free time that I have with a family and a full-time job.

## The Other Problem

Not sure that it's a problem as much as something else to keep an eye out for. Once I make time, I need to make time __for__ this. I've been feeling like it recently, and I think writing is one of those things that finally "clicked" for me.

# The Other Stuff

## We Stayed in Maine, but Three Hours Away

This year marks the first time that my family has been on a vacation that was fully planned and paid for without anyone else.

See the [[About#^f7a398\|FAQ]]

So onwards to the vacation. My wife is an amazing researcher and planner, which are amazing skills that I have just one of (hint: it's researching). She found an AirBNB listing up north of Portland, ME by about fourish hours (a bit under three and a half from where we are). Months previous to now, she started the booking and getting as much information together as possible

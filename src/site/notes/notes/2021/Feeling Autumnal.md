## Many Things Have Already Changed

The days are already too short, which makes sense as we're more than halfway between the longest and shortest days of the year. Being in the northeastern part of the US, the leaves are changing and dropping quickly. Today marked the first morning under 40°F (4.4°C), which was quite refreshing since we'd left our bedroom window open through the night.

Since I last wrote here, I planned out and got my first tattoo - and love it. It was done by [Phuc Tran](https://www.phucskywalker.com/) at [Tsunami Tattoo](https://www.tsunamitattoo.com/) in  Portland, ME.

Not the best photo, maybe I'll get a better one once it's nicer out. Already planning the next one, or two.

It was a fine day about 18 years ago when I first decided to register [dropcase.com](http://www.dropcase.com). I couldn't tell you what day it was, only that I know when I have to renew so that was the "official" date.

Then, like now, I was at a point where I not only decided what to put on my site, but how to manage it.

Flat HTML? No way, although that's almost what I'm back to now.

Write my own? I can work with code, but I'm not writing my own anything (yet).

CMS, then I can play with [[reference/2025/PHP\|PHP]] and [[reference/2025/MySQL\|MySQL]] on my freshly-purchased hosting plan (via NoMonthlyFees.com)? Yes, that's great.

There was probably some record of my fumblings through deciding on what to use. I think the first pass was Greymatter, or maybe it was the hand-coded option. Just like today, I don't have much of an eye for the design side of it (for myself anyway). I look for function over form in most cases.

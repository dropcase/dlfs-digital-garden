## So I Was Doing Just About Anything Else

Not really though. It's been super busy with work, and I've been writing in my own [[reference/2025/Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] and doing so consistently. It combines a few things into one place, including a journal, [[reference/2025/spark\|spark]] idea capture, and a bookmark-wiki-ish setup for my own reference catalog.

Writing there has helped me clarify some of the ideas rolling around in my head, even if it's not always clear when I write them down.

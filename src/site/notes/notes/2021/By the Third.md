Pattern recognition is a wonderful and awful thing. Yes, it's allowed us to evolve to the point where we can express ourselves in more ways than any humans in history.

It also means that we can __repeat__ those patterns too. For example, when I try out a new webbish thing - CMS, SSG, etc. - the first few entries are about __that__. I guess that's my typical starting point, like a pivot to the new whatever.

This is still exactly one of those patterns, and I fully plan on writing more about the platform or system I use along the way. It helps with making sense of what I'm learning along with a running record of where I've progressed from.

Current setup: [[reference/2025/Eleventy\|Eleventy]], using the starter blog. Tied to a [[reference/2025/GitHub\|GitHub]] repo, and Netlify to help wrangle things into shape.

Also, I need to decorate this place.

# First, Welcome

I'm Dave, aka dropcase. This is the latest version of the site, and more closely aligned with how my brain works. More on that later though, unless you want to jump into [[reference/2025/Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] and [[reference/2025/Obsidian\|Obsidian]].

Very much a work in progress, there are a lot of holes to fill in with writing I've done and notes to fill out and create.

## Time to Re-Re-Re-Restart the Process

Scattered throughout this site, you'll find more than one starting point. Some from old copies of content, some while I was trying to get changed over to another platform, and some just because I wrote it and wanted to keep it. This is another one of those starting points.

One day I'll pull a bunch of the ideas out of my [[reference/2025/Obsidian\|Obsidian]] vault and make them into notes here. Until that happens, it'll just be slowly piecing together the framework and foundation of the site to build from. I know that the [[About\|About]] page has some of it, and I'll try to connect more ideas together along the way.

There will be a lot of changes to the setup while I sort things out. Not that anyone is reading this, but don't save any bookmarks for a while (or just use the built-in)

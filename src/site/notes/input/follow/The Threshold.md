## Notes

As I've been building up this digital garden, I was looking at the way that other people have built their sites out. From the main [[input/follow/Obsidian Digital Garden\|Obsidian Digital Garden]] page, this site was linked as a good example of [Adding custom components](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/advanced/adding-custom-components/).

It's inspiring and I'm going to use some of the features they've put together to update my own site. I also like their take on things - not in it for clout or interactions, just sharing and hoping people find it interesting or useful. I can definitely relate to that.

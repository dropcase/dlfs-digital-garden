## Notes

I'm not sure when I first heard about kepano, it might've been when I was starting to really get into [[input/learn/Obsidian\|Obsidian]] and spending a lot of time on the forums. It was great to see him joining discussions and hearing his take on things.

His take on a lot of things seems similar to my own, and at the same time I've learned a lot from his writing. I don't have a list of people that I'd like to meet, but he'd be on it if I did.

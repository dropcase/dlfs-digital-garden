## Notes

I started using it for a couple of small things quite a few years ago. Now it's helping me manage versioning for things ranging from my janky code to my writing projects to my [[reference/2025/Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]], and more.

As of 2025, I'm still using [[input/dev/GitHub\|GitHub]] for almost all of it. That may change if I can find something to suit my needs and not as concerned with someone else deciding if I should be shut off. I had my account frozen at one point (misfire on their Spam monitoring), and made me realize how dependent I am on that access.

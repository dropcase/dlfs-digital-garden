## Notes
I started learning PHP back in 2003. Still not proficient but somewhat comfortable. I usually paired it with [[input/dev/MySQL\|MySQL]] for projects I was working on

As of 2025, I picked it back up to play with some data and throw something together. It was nice to have something familiar, and see how much progress has been made with new versions (current release as I'm writing this is 8.4.11)

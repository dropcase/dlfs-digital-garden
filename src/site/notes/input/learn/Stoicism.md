**Wikipedia**: [Stoicism - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism)

> **Stoicism** is a school of [Hellenistic philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_philosophy "Hellenistic philosophy") that flourished in [ancient Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece") and [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome "Ancient Rome").[^1] The Stoics believed that the universe operated according to reason, _i.e._ by a God which is immersed in nature itself.[^2] Of all the schools of ancient philosophy, Stoicism made the greatest claim to being utterly systematic.[^3] The Stoics provided a unified account of the world, constructed from ideals of [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic"), [monistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism "Monism") physics, and [naturalistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalism_\(philosophy\) "Naturalism (philosophy)") ethics.[^4] These three ideals constitute virtue, which is necessary for 'living a well-reasoned life', seeing as they are all parts of a logos, or philosophical discourse, which includes the mind's rational dialogue with itself.[^5]

> Stoicism was founded in the [ancient Agora of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Agora_of_Athens "Ancient Agora of Athens") by [Zeno of Citium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium "Zeno of Citium") around 300 BC, and flourished throughout the [Greco-Roman world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Roman_world "Greco-Roman world") until the 3rd century AD. Among its adherents was Roman Emperor [Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius "Marcus Aurelius"). Along with Aristotelian [term logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_logic "Term logic"), the system of [propositional logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_logic "Propositional logic") developed by the Stoics was one of the two great systems of logic in the classical world. It was largely built and shaped by [Chrysippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysippus "Chrysippus"), the third head of the Stoic school in the 3rd century BCE. Chrysippus's logic differed from [term logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_logic "Term logic") because it was based on the analysis of [propositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition "Proposition") rather than terms.
>
> Stoicism experienced a decline after [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity") became the state religion in the 4th century AD. Since then, it has seen revivals, notably in the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_philosophy "Renaissance philosophy") ([Neostoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neostoicism "Neostoicism")) and in the contemporary era.[^6]

## Notes

I don't remember when I first learned about Stoicism. What I do know is that it's been part of my [[reference/2025/Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] since early 2020 when I first started using [[input/learn/Roam\|Roam]].

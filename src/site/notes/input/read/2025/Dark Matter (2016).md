## Notes

I read that faster than I thought I would. I liked it, good world-building and character setup. Clever twists along the way, and I figured out a couple of things ahead of reveals but also surprised by a few.

Also, I didn't connect the dots until after I finished the book. There's a series on Apple TV for it, and I already added it to my watch list to check out.

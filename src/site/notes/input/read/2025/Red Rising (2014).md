## Notes

This book was on my to-read list for a while. Picked it up at the library and liked it right away. Bonus, it's a trilogy! No wait, it _was_ a trilogy and now it's labeled as a saga!

Great start, and I liked the characters. The author also does a good job of laying out the foundation of not only what the main character is going through and how they came to be where they are, but also pulling back the curtain on the society that they're a part of.

There were vibes of a space opera, Hunger Games, The Running Man, and still stood on its own.

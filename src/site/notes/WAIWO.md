First, quick intro to `WAIWO` - What Am I Working On, the process I've been using to attempt to keep track of the things I'm interested in. Sometimes I remember and try to look at it to stay on track. Most of the time it's more like "oh yeah shit I should use that again" (ugh). I guess OYSISUTA helps with WAIWO.

Might come back and link things when I have more added to the site, but for now I'll just leave the list there.

## High-level list
- Outdoor stuff
  - Living in the Northeast US
  - Hiking, camping, biking, hammocking
- Indoor stuff
  - Cards, board games, writing, knitting, crochet
- Virtual Stuff
  - [[reference/2025/Personal Knowledge Management\|Personal Knowledge Management aka PKM]]
  - uh, this site?

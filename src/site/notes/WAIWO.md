First, quick intro to `WAIWO` - What Am I Working On, the process I've been using to attempt to keep track of the things I'm interested in. Sometimes I remember and try to look at it to stay on track. Most of the time it's more like "oh yeah shit I should use that again" (ugh). I guess OYSISUTA helps with WAIWO.

I'll try to come back and link things as I add to the site, but for now I'll just leave the list there.

## High-level list

  - [[reference/2025/Personal Knowledge Management\|Personal Knowledge Management aka PKM]], like [[input/learn/Obsidian\|Obsidian]]

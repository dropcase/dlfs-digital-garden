I don't remember when I first learned about a spark file, but it's been a long time - 2012ish sounds about right:

[The Spark File \| by Steven Johnson \| The Writerâ€™s Room \| Medium](https://medium.com/the-writers-room/the-spark-file-8d6e7df7ae58)

The general idea is to write down _anything_ you want to keep, even a piece of an idea, or something that's an incomplete thought. Every once in a while, read through the whole thing and see what your mind finds for dots to connect.

## Notes
I like knowing what I've seen and (roughly) when I've watched it. Previously I was using ReelGood and it was close but not quite what I was looking for.

Then in 2023 (on June 1st, thanks Trakt) I switched over and started updating a _lot_ of content that I've consumed. Current stats as of August 9th, 2025:

Damn, that's a solid amount. It also includes some "retro" updates based on the info in my [[reference/2025/Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] since I usually write about what I've been watching (or want to watch).

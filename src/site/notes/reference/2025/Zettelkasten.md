## The What

From [Zettelkasten - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten):
> A **_Zettelkasten_** ([German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language"): 'slipbox', plural **_Zettelkästen_**) or **card file** consists of small items of information stored on _Zetteln_ (German: 'slips'), paper slips or cards, that may be linked to each other through [subject headings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_term "Index term") or other [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata "Metadata") such as numbers and [tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_\(metadata\) "Tag (metadata)"). It has often been used as a system of [note-taking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note-taking "Note-taking") and [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management "Personal knowledge management") for research, study, and writing.

## My Take
It's amazing what one person was able to build with just slips of paper (highly organized, but still)

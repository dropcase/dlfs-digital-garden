## Notes

My current [[reference/2025/Personal Knowledge Management\|PKM]] of choice. I did try it out back in late 2020 but couldn't get it to a point where it didn't feel like more work just to _use_ it.

Fast forward to late 2023 and it was fully on my radar again. I was using [[reference/2025/Roam\|Roam]] and although I really liked it for the most part, there were things that were either directly or indirectly (like plugins/extensions) missing.

I started planning the transition and even worked on an update to the Importer plugin to streamline Roam exports. I made the full cutover on May 24th, 2024. Since then I've done a lot of gardening to get things where I want them. If you're in the PKM space you've likely heard of evergreen notes; this is an evergreen process.

After a few waves of cleanup, my vault has 9929 notes altogether and the graph looks like this (as of 2025-08-09):

**Wikipedia**: [Personal knowledge management - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management)
> **Personal knowledge management** (**PKM**) is a process of collecting information that a person uses to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge "Knowledge") in their daily activities ([Grundspenkis 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management#CITEREFGrundspenkis2007)) and the way in which these processes support work activities ([Wright 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management#CITEREFWright2005)). It is a response to the idea that [knowledge workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker "Knowledge worker") need to be responsible for their own growth and learning ([Smedley 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management#CITEREFSmedley2009)). It is a bottom-up approach to [knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management "Knowledge management") (KM) ([Pollard 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management#CITEREFPollard2008)).

## Notes

Over the years I've used a lot of different ways to capture ideas and other things. For a long time it was paper notebooks and index cards, and unsurprisingly I don't have a lot of those 30 years later. That's not to say that I don't have _any_ of it, just that there's a lot that was lost.

The first virtual steps were with Microsoft Word or other word processors, text editors (I hadn't learned about the magic of vi or emacs yet), and whatever janky Unix setup my college used. 

Getting into the 2000s, I found and started using [[input/learn/Evernote\|Evernote]] regularly. In a very hindsight way, I shouldn't've dumped my entire del.ici.ous list into it to "clean up" since it might still mostly be there.

I've used so many things, after Evernote I was using Google Docs (now Drive) a lot which helped with migrating platforms along the way. Jumping to 2020, that's when I found [[input/learn/Roam\|Roam]] (and [[input/learn/Obsidian\|Obsidian]] a few months later) and have kept a second brain going since.

That's not to say it's the _only_ method I use, notebooks and index cards are still options and what I think to grab when I need to draw something out a bit.

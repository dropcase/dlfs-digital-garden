## Notes
The first DB or RDBMS that I used, back in 2003 (along with [[reference/2025/PHP\|PHP]]). Back then it was its own thing, now owned by Oracle.

It helped me learn SQL, and while I'm not advanced with it in any way, I'm comfortable enough that it helps me with some of my current role for work.
